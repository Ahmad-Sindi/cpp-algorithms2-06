Algorithm Challenge #6 – Sum of Digits of a Number
-
🧮 Problem Description
This program reads a positive integer from the user and calculates the sum of all its digits.
It repeatedly extracts each digit using modulo (%) and division, then accumulates the total.

Example
-
Input: 1234

Output: 10

This challenge reinforces digit extraction, arithmetic operations, loops, and clean functional structure in C++.
